## North Star Metric

 ***Average Number of Panels Generated/Creator/Month***

### What is a panel?

In a comic book, a panel is a distinct segment of the page containing an illustration or a sequence of illustrations depicting a particular moment in the story. Panels are typically bordered by lines or gutters, which separate them from adjacent panels. They serve as the building blocks of the visual narrative, conveying actions, dialogue, emotions, and other story elements.

## Reflection

After the initial brainstorming phase we had two competing metrics that we had drilled down to : "Monthly Active Users (creators)" and "comic panels created / user / month."  The metric "Monthly Active Users (creators)" initially stood out for its straightforwardness and emphasis on broad engagement. It tracks the vitality of our platform by counting how many users actively engage in content creation, driving us towards strategies that boost user acquisition, retention, and activity. While this metric offers a clear measure of our platform's capacity to attract and maintain an active creator base, it leans more towards quantifying user presence rather than the depth of their engagement or the quality of their output.

Contrastingly, the metric "comic panels created / user / month" dives deeper into understanding user engagement and productivity. It doesn’t merely measure active users but assesses the extent of their engagement through the volume of content they produce. This focus nudges us to develop features and tools that not only draw creators to our platform but also significantly enhance their creative process. Such a metric fosters a community where creators aren’t just present but are deeply involved in producing complex and high-quality comics. It aligns perfectly with our vision to not just grow a user base but to nurture a thriving community of active creators.

After careful consideration, we've decided that "comic panels created / user / month" stands as the superior North Star Metric for ArtBasket AI. This choice underlines our commitment to cultivating a platform where the emphasis is not only on increasing the number of users but on deepening their engagement and boosting their productivity.

In developing the north star metric and associated strategies for ArtBasket AI, our focus has been on fostering a thriving ecosystem where creators feel empowered and supported in their comic creation endeavors. We've recognized that the success of our product hinges on both attracting new creators and ensuring the satisfaction and engagement of existing ones.

By prioritizing breadth, we aim to not only increase our reach but also lays the foundation for a diverse and vibrant community of creators. AI-assisted story development, customizable art styles, and access to a rich template library are geared towards enabling creators to produce high-quality comics with greater ease and efficiency. Frequency plays a crucial role in sustaining creator engagement over time. Ensuring the efficiency of our AI-generated outputs is paramount in building trust and satisfaction among creators.

In essence, our approach is centered on creating value for creators at every stage of their journey, from initial inspiration to final output. By fostering a supportive and innovative environment, we aim to establish ArtBasket AI as the go-to platform for comic creation, driving growth and success for both our users and our product.
