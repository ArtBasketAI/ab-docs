# ArtBasket Frontend Design Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the frontend design, architecture, technology choices, and structure for the ArtBasket project. The frontend is designed to provide an intuitive and responsive user interface for exploring and interacting with the marketplace for comics.

### Design Choices

- **Framework:** We chose Next.js with TypeScript for its server-side rendering capabilities, ease of routing, and strong type-checking features.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid development of custom designs without the need for extensive CSS files.
- **State Management:** React Context API is utilized for managing global state without the overhead of more complex solutions like Redux.

### Architecture

The frontend architecture is structured to support modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

- **Pages:** Each page corresponds to a route and is responsible for rendering the layout and components specific to that route.
- **Components:** Reusable UI components are used throughout the application to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication.
- **Services:** API calls and business logic are abstracted into service files to separate concerns and simplify component code.

### Technology Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
- **Firebase:** Used for authentication and data storage.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

### Frontend Structure

The frontend is organized into several key directories:

- **pages:** Contains the page components, each corresponding to a route.
- **components:** Holds reusable UI components like buttons, cards, and modals.
- **styles:** Includes global CSS and Tailwind configuration files.
- **services:** Contains files for API calls and other business logic.
- **hooks:** Custom React hooks for shared logic across components.
- **utils:** Utility functions and constants used throughout the application.

### Component Library

To ensure a consistent look and feel across the application, a component library is maintained with the following key components:

- **Button:** A customizable button component for various actions.
- **Card:** A card component for displaying comic information.
- **Navbar:** The navigation bar component for site-wide navigation.
- **Modal:** A reusable modal component for displaying content in a dialog.

## Conclusion

The frontend design of ArtBasket is focused on providing a seamless user experience while maintaining a scalable and maintainable codebase. By leveraging modern technologies and following best practices, we aim to create an engaging platform for comic enthusiasts and creators alike.
