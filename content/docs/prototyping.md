## Figma for ArtBasket Wireframing

## Introduction

This document outlines the use of Figma as the prototyping tool for the initial wireframing of the ArtBasket project. Figma is a web-based vector graphics editor and prototyping tool that is widely used for designing user interfaces and user experiences.

## Why Figma?

- **Collaboration:** Figma allows multiple team members to work on the same design file simultaneously, making it ideal for collaborative design efforts.
- **Accessibility:** Being web-based, Figma can be accessed from any computer with an internet connection, without the need for installing software.
- **Versatility:** Figma supports both wireframing and high-fidelity design, allowing us to use a single tool for the entire design process.

## ArtBasket Wireframing Process

1. **Setting Up the Project:** We started by creating a new project in Figma and setting up a grid system to ensure consistency across our designs.
2. **Creating Wireframes:** We used Figma's vector tools to create wireframes for each page of the ArtBasket website, focusing on layout and user flow.
3. **Adding Interactivity:** Using Figma's prototyping features, we added interactions and transitions to simulate the user experience.
4. **Collaborative Feedback:** Team members and stakeholders were invited to view and comment on the wireframes directly in Figma, allowing for quick feedback and iterations.

## Figma Features Used

- **Vector Tools:** Used for creating shapes, icons, and other graphical elements.
- **Frames and Components:** Used to organize designs and create reusable elements.
- **Prototyping:** Used to link frames and create interactive prototypes.
- **Comments:** Used for gathering feedback from team members and stakeholders.

## Sharing and Collaboration

- **Link Sharing:** We shared the Figma file with team members and stakeholders via a shareable link.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Team members were able to edit and comment on the design in real time.

## Conclusion

Figma proved to be an invaluable tool for the initial wireframing of the ArtBasket project. Its collaboration features and ease of use enabled us to quickly iterate on our designs and gather feedback from stakeholders.
