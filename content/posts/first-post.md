## Motivation

This project was initially inspired becasue some of I have consistently failed at completing some of the literary and artistic projects that we had ongoing. This is especially a big problem when you have a huge idea that you want to pen down but never get around to completing it as life ahppens and you have to put down this endeavor in favor of some thing more urgent.

Also resuming the project after a long time is pretty daunting since now you no longer have context of what you were workin on. So I imagines if there was a tool that would remember summarize my earlier thoughts and help me make steady progress would be helpful.

The explosive growth of Generative AI make the decision of pursuing and actaully building something useful even if it is only for personal use great.

## Expected outcome

build a working website and tool for automating repetitive tasks easier.
